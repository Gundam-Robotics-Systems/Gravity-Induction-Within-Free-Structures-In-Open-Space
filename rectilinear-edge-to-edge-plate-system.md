Building designs that mitigate "dead zones" or weak gravity in corners requires moving away from traditional cylindrical/circular induction rings toward a **rectilinear edge-to-edge plate system**. By treating the entire floor and ceiling as continuous capacitive surfaces, you ensure a uniform field density across the entire cabin volume.

Here are three design concepts for floor and ceiling panels optimized for edge-to-edge gravity coverage.

1\. The "Tessellated Hex-Grid" Panel
------------------------------------

Instead of circular rings, these panels use a honeycomb geometry. Hexagons allow for the most efficient "packing" of a surface, ensuring that the charge is distributed right up to the wall interface.

-   **Design:** Interlocking hexagonal plates with high-density conductive "veins" that concentrate the electron charge toward the edges.

-   **Advantage:** Eliminates the drop-off seen in circular designs. The "corners" are no longer empty; they are the junction points of three separate hexagonal charge-concentrators.

-   **Material:** Boron-nitride nanotubes embedded in a carbon-fiber matrix for high capacitance and structural armor integrity.

2\. Cross-Phase Laminate Plates (Edge-Dominant)
-----------------------------------------------

This design uses overlapping rectangular layers that are "over-driven" at the perimeter.

-   **Design:** A multi-layered sandwich where the primary charge-carrying layer extends slightly past the floor-to-wall junction. The "Ceiling" panels are mirrored precisely to the "Floor" panels to ensure parallel field lines.

-   **The "Corner Fix":** We integrate **Peripheral Induction Rails**---specialized high-voltage strips that run along the baseboards and crown molding. These rails create a "lens" effect, bending the electron force lines inward at the corners to prevent field thinning.

-   **Control:** Digital potentiometers at every corner junction allow you to manually "boost" the gravity in the room's corners via the ship's terminal.

3\. Modular "Smart-Slab" Armor Panels
-------------------------------------

Since you mentioned using armor plates as charge surfaces, these panels double as the ship's secondary hull.

-   **Design:** Each slab is a 2m x 2m square. The edges of the slabs use **Inductive Bridge Couplers**. When two slabs are bolted together, they form a seamless electrical connection.

-   **Field Uniformity:** By using a "solid charge surface" (as mentioned in your repository) rather than wire coils, the entire surface area of the plate acts as a single gravity-inducing electrode.

-   **Maintenance:** Since they are modular, if a specific corner loses "weight" due to a plate failure, you can swap the individual smart-slab without tearing out the whole floor.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Corner Field Density** | Low (Dead Zones) | High (Uniform) | Maximum (Overlapping) |
| **Field Shape** | Cylindrical / Focused | Planar / Rectangular | Omnidirectional |
| **Structural Role** | Internal Only | Integrated Armor | Internal Framework |
